    <p class="apologia">NOTE: These texts are not ones I understand. The author has earned no relationship with the counter-texts, but hopes nonetheless to be a vector for a few spores of their meanings and forms, not mine. Due to the hegemonic dynamics of algorithmic language processing, all texts are considered only in their English translation. The other side of this coin is the greater subtlety, evasions, and obscurities from surveillance possible in languages that the Large Language Models and other Natural Language Processors aren't yet trained on (Spanish and Portuguese cannot really be considered safe in this way).</p>
